# JavaFX_Projects

➡️ I explored JavaFX and made few projects, some of them are :

1. Tic Tac Toe (basic gameplay)
2. BMI Calculator (calculates your Body Mass Index)
3. Indian Flag (a simple tribute)

**You can see the output of all these projects in this Linkedin post :** https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rushi-bhatti_java-javafx-gameusingjavafx-activity-7182686062094270465-Mm8K?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android
(This post contains execution video of all these projects!)
